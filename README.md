# Secode
- Secode - a python3 command line static code analyzer for C source files. It analyzes the code line by line and creates a list for each vulnerability with a scale of severity for each hit ranging from 1 to 5.
- It also prints out suggestions/alternate functions for each hit on each line .
- It has a ruleset with a total of 233  insecure C functions which it compares during its analysis.

# This Version
- this is the build that i maintained on my system , i prefer how its laid out . I contributed to secode's development on the main repo.
